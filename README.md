# NMT-augment
Data Augmentation for Neural Machine Translation

In the global landscape of today, effective communication across languages is essential. Yet, low-resource languages encounter substantial barriers due to the scarcity of available data. These languages are at a disadvantage with limited access to automatic translation services, with some not being supported by leading online translation platforms such as Google Translate. The challenge extends to securing large, high-quality datasets, which are crucial for traditional deep-learning approaches that depend on extensive training data.

This project seeks to address a critical issue in the field of machine translation: the data scarcity for low-resource languages. We aim to evaluate and compare different data augmentation strategies, specifically focusing on improving machine translation for these underrepresented languages.
